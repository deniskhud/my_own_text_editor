# `khud` - my own terminal written in C

## Terminal features: 

- Open and display text files
- Scroll through file contents
- Move the cursor across lines and columns
- Show a welcome message when no file is open
- Minimal, `vim`/`nano`-like interface


## Build and Run:

```bash
gcc -o khud khud.c -Wall -Wextra
